# Trivial single-player co-op demo 
## Initial experimenting with GameMaker 

This is my first work using GameMaker Studio Professional since I purchased the [GameMaker Humble Bundle](https://www.yoyogames.com/blog/389) a while back.  I've always wanted to created games for the Amazon Fire TV and it looks like GameMaker could provide an quick way to do so.

My initial experimental idea was to create a trivial single-player co-op demo.  This would allow you to control 4 players with either keyboard or gamepad and switch between them.  This was inspired by a similar mechanism used in most of the Lego games by [Traveller's Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller%27s_Tales).

This work would not have been possible without [Shaun Spalding's fantastic GameMaker tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/999Greyfox).

* Keyboard controls :- arrow keys and space bar to change player
* Gamepad controls :- left analogue stick and "Y" button to change player
